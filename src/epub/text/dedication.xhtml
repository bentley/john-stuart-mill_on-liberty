			<p>To the beloved and deplored memory of her who was the inspirer, and in part the author, of all that is best in my writings⁠—the friend and wife whose exalted sense of truth and right was my strongest incitement, and whose approbation was my chief reward⁠—I dedicate this volume. Like all that I have written for many years, it belongs as much to her as to me; but the work as it stands has had, in a very insufficient degree, the inestimable advantage of her revision; some of the most important portions having been reserved for a more careful reexamination, which they are now never destined to receive. Were I but capable of interpreting to the world one-half the great thoughts and noble feelings which are buried in her grave, I should be the medium of a greater benefit to it than is ever likely to arise from anything that I can write, unprompted and unassisted by her all but unrivalled wisdom.</p>
